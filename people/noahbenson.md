Noah Benson is a senior data scientist at the University of Washington’s
eScience Institute. He received his B.S. from Purdue University where
triple-majored in computer science, math, and biology (2001-2005) and his
Ph.D. in biomedical and health informatics from the University of Washington
where he studied the analysis and representation of molecular dynamics
simulations (2005-2010). Since graduating, Noah has worked primarily in the
domain of human neuroscience and vision with an emphasis on understanding the
relationship between the anatomical structure of the brain and its function. He
has worked as a post-doctoral associate at the University of Pennsylvania
(2010-2014) and a research scientist at New York University (2014-2020).

The primary goal of Noah’s research is to understand how the 3D structure of
the human cerebral cortex is related to its organization and function. His work
primarily examines the visual system, the structure and function of which can
be easily queried with high spatial resolution using MRI. His work on the first
three cortical visual areas (V1, V2, and V3) has shown how the cortical map (a
canonical feature of how cortical areas are organized) can be modeled in terms
of the brain’s sulcal topography and predicted in a subject based on that
topography alone (Benson et al., 2012; Benson et al., 2014; Benson and Winawer,
2018). He has also worked extensively with data from the Human Connectome
Project (Benson et al., 2018).

Noah has spent much of his research career writing and supporting software
tools that enable other researchers to duplicate and extend his work. He
supports and has contributed to a number of open-source libraries on GitHub and
is the author of the Python library neuropythy, a general utility library built
around understanding neuroscience data formats, anatomical analysis, and
visualization. Among other things, neuropythy is a powerful tool for
organizing, obtaining, and understanding the data from the Human Connectome
Project.
