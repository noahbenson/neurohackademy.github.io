Ariel Rokem is a Research Associate Professor at the University of Washington
Department of Psychology. He received a PhD in Neuroscience from UC Berkeley
(2010) and additional postdoctoral training in computational neuroimaging at
Stanford (2011 – 2015). He was also previously a Senior Data Scientist at the
University of Washington eScience Institute (2015-2020)

He leads a research program in neuroinformatics, the development of data
science tools, techniques and methods and their application to the analysis of
neural data. One thrust of this research focuses specifically on the
application of methods from statistical learning to analysis of diffusion MRI
data acquired in human brain. This type of data sheds light on the role that
human brain connections play in cognitive abilities, in diverse behaviors, and
in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Another thrust of the research focuses specifically on the development of
systems for analysis (e.g., Mehta et al. 2017, Richford and Rokem, 2018) and
sharing (e.g. Yeatman et al. 2018) of large-scale open datasets, to enable
research with datasets that are increasingly becoming available through
data-sharing initiatives, and to facilitate its reproducibility.

He is a member of the Software and Data Carpentry communities, where he has
been an instructor since 2013 and an instructor trainer 2015. He also directs
the annual Summer Institute for Neuroimaging and Data Science
(NeuroHackademy). A contributor to multiple open-source software projects in
the scientific Python ecosystem, he is a member of the editorial board of the
Journal for Open Source Software (JOSS).
